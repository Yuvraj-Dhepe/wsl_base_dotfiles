- To do:
1) Remember zshrc is already configured to use extensions via the antibody extensions file.
2) Install proper cuda for support of torch and torchvision
{
1) For cuda, we need to install toolkit even if the GPU driver is installed.

ref: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=WSL-Ubuntu&target_version=2.0&target_type=deb_local
ref: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux
https://linuxhint.com/install-cuda-ubuntu-2004/
2) Once those installations are done, also download the cuda toolkit. sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit.
3) Download toolkit for windows as well and install it along with the gameforce driver.
}
-- try this: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --no-index --find-links https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu115/torch_stable.html for the timebeing.
